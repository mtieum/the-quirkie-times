description: A recap of the past two weeks of Syntribos Saturday spaces
---
Every Saturday (Sunday AEST time) the Quirkies founder, Syntribos, hosts an official space to update the community on potential new knowledge and answer a limited number of questions from the community.  Here’s a recap of the last two spaces:  

Saturday, July 30 - Sleapy is from Sydney, Australia. She works in construction & infrastructure. She manages bids to government and private clients. She has 3 kids under the age of 3. 
Sleapy met Syntribos through Signline last year (2021). Sleapy is motivated to elevate the Quirkies brand and bring it global recognition. Here favorite part of Quirkies is the relationships she has made along the way. 

Saturday, August 6 - Quirkies holders own the IP. If anyone else is using the art, the holder has a direct claim over it. The main focus for the Qurikies team is to build out the web2 business thus igniting momentum to the web3 side as well.   Quirksville apparel map launch! Web 2 branding and completing agreements currently under NDA. Quirklings first edition merch coming soon. Quirkies will not go down the path of public domain (CCO). First seasonal tier-drop coming soon and will be available to everyone 24/7/365.
