**Q﻿uirkie of the Week #8** - @TMan_423

Howdy. It is an honor to be named Quirkie of the week. I really don’t feel like I have done anything to deserve it, except hang out with friends on Twitter Spaces, laughing and having fun, and I would never expect to be given anything for that. But it is an honor to be acknowledged and this being a vote by fellow Quirkies humbles me. By the grace of God, I have lived in rural East Tennessee my whole life. I know nobody in real life who even knows what an NFT is. While I have been in I.T. for over 20 years, most people in I.T. have no interest in Web 3 or decentralized ownership. I am ancient by NFT standards at 48-years-old and have a wife and two young kids, having started a family later in life. My kids and wife will always be my biggest assets – my grails. I am very bullish on having kids and settling down as you get older, but also encourage young people to enjoy their youth while they can. I got into NFTs in March 2021 playing Axie. I was a first mover and success there allowed me to expand into other PTE’s and eventually PFPs. What attracted me to the space was anonymous digital ownership of assets as well as the dream of decentralizing power back to individuals. I never planned to not dox, but lately it seems like more and more people are demanding people dox against their wills. One of the greatest things about Web 3 to me, though, is you can choose to remain anonymous if you choose for any reason or for no reason. It does not mean you have something to hide. I just means you want privacy, which you might need to look up in a dictionary if you are under 40. I am hopeful I will see y'all at a Quirkie IRL event very soon, but even then, I will just go by TMan instead of my birth name. Quirkies was my first PFP project and I feel blessed to have found it. In Quirkies, Community IS the team. I have made more friends in Quirksville than I have since high school. There are some amazing and beautiful souls who happen to own Quirkies. To me, this is the alpha of Quirkies – the people you meet here are actually great, authentic people. Quirkies has given me more than I ever could give Quirkies. I never would have imagined that a PFP NFT would bring people together like this. While diversity where I live is little, in Quirksville my best friends are from all parts of the world, all races, all religions, and all sides of the political spectrum. Here were are just all Quirkies with our quirks and inclusivity is the rule, not the exception. I feel very blessed to be on this journey to the unknown with all of you. And we are just getting started. Let’s F’n Go!!!
