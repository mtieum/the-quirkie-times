**Community Website**: @BigCritBritt, @oristat1 &@Jclutch_eth have been building a community website with its own ominous story line to be the central hub for all the amazing projects being built by our community! Follow [@quirkexplorer](https://twitter.com/quirkexplorer) to stay up to date with the story and site!

**Vision Dao**: The recently launched Vision DAO was created to deepen relationships in WEB3 and make incredible gains while doing so. The Vision DAO sets out to create investing strategies through community voting that will aim for a 50x return in the first year. Thank you @macintosh_eth for your efforts!

**Quirkies Security Quiz:** Coming soon from @mtieum! A continuous security quiz to help prepare and encourage holders to practice safe trading/purchasing/selling of their valuable NFTs!

**Official Album Drop:** Quirkies has some of the most talented musicians in the space! Stay tuned; they will be working on something special! 

**Community Merch:** We've seen a few pieces of merchandise made by the community for the *Finch Skull Gang* & *Hockey Mask Mafia* (@TheReal_FFDoom), *Astroquirkies* (@Dr3wrightnow) and *For The Qulture* (@Here4NFTs)! Some new pieces for those groups AND introducing the *Donut Gang* (@princessashleiv) merch soon! 

**The Quirkie Times Newsletter:** We're live from Quirksville, brought to you by @ClarkQuirk!

**IRL Events:** Leaders from New York/California/Florida are putting together some in real life events for holders and holder frens! We are also looking forward to seeing some other irl events across the globe! 

**A Donut Story:** The *Donut Gang* will be releasing a storyline very soon! 

**Playing Cards:** @BigCritBritt took her flat art Quirkie talent to retail! First edition decks were completed and ordered already and we look forward to seeing the next few editions of designs to include some more OG Quirkies & Quirklings!

**Community Poker:** Contact coordinator @mike_eth17 for more info!

**BIG** shout out to @jpgPapiii for making this community roadmap happen, @Kentasi2 for the spectacular artwork and the Quirkies community for always wanting to go hard!
