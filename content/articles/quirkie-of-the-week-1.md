**Quirkie of the Week #2 - *WillyEsthetics***

<img src="/img/image0-1-.jpeg" alt="" title="WillyEsthetics" class=""/>

Dear Quirksville: You may already know me by my web3 name “Willy”(WillyEsthetics). In real life away from Discord and Twitter, my name is Aaron. I’m 22 years old and was born and raised in Leipzig, a beautiful city in Germany. I currently study art and sport near Berlin at the University of Potsdam for about a year now. I bought my first Quirkie in early March and have been completely in love with the world of Quirksville ever since. I've been creating all kinds of art for the community since the beginning, mostly Quirkie banners and more recently a lot of community lore. Due to your incredible feedback, I found my love for digital art again and have an incredible amount of motivation to pursue this professionally in the future. I am deeply grateful to all of you for that! I highly appreciate the values our community stands for and the vision the project is after. For this reason I am the proud owner of 2 OG Quirkie Sets and another grail Quirkling. Much love to all of you!



**Quirkie of the Week #3 - *Mike.eth***

Hello Quirksville! My name is Mike (Mike.eth). I live in Montreal, Canada with my wife and 2 little children. By day, I work in the mental health and virtual care field. By night, I am as degen as you can get in Web3. Currently rocking 4 quirkies sets, a few more quirks and quirklings as well. Some of you may know me as the poker guy, but I started these poker games to bring the community together on an almost nightly basis and give everyone the chance to win some quirks and quirklings! Truly blessed to have met you all (need to shoutout the VR chat family) and can't wait to see what Quirksville looks like by next year!
