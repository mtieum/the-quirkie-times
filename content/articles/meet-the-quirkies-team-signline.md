Signline has been drawing since the age of 10, being able to replicate anything he saw. But art wouldn’t be his first venture in the real world. At the young age of 16, Signline left home and jumped into real estate. He accomplished home ownership quickly with closing the deal on his first home only two years later. Over the years he has acquired five houses until he was ready to settle down and sell them all to purchase the one house he owns today. Signline is a family man – he is the father to three children who keep him on his toes.

When he is not at home, you can find Signline at work. He owns a signage company (hence his social media persona) but he does much more than just signage. He has been producing apparel like t-shirts and hats as well as wrapping cars in vinyl that he designs. He also works closely with the likes of the Australian government, Australia Parks & Wildlife, well-known companies such as Hermes and gasoline companies like Shell and BP. Sign is hardworking; he is obsessed with his job and can never disconnect fully from it. He loves creating content for people both professionally and in his spare time, which is why you may see a lot of Signline-produced graphics that pop up on Twitter all times of the day.

Sign’s NFT journey started back in May of 2021. He came across ZedRun and began doing some major research until he finally pulled the trigger on his first NFT purchase that July. Sign began digging deeper into other projects, learning the ins and outs of investing. He met Syntribos in ZedRun and took a liking to him. Sign created a 1/1 art for Syn and this sparked the friendship between them. They began investing into mutual projects together and when Syn decided to establish his genesis project, he knew just the right person to be a part of his team as a Community Manager. After the launch of the genesis project, Syn decided to build Quirkies and did not hesitate to bring Signline along as well.

Quirkies has opened new opportunities for Signline. He has made a few long-lasting friendships on this journey, and he isn’t planning on stopping any time soon. Signline is FULL STEAM AHEAD!
