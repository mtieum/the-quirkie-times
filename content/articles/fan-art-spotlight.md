In this edition of the Quirkie Fan Art Spotlight, I am focused on the attention grabbing, hand drawn, neon light fan art that @TrentPulsipher has been dropping in the community for the past few months. @TrentPulsipher has been vibing with the Quirkies since pre-reveal and has consistently been a genuine and kind quirk in our community. The piece I selected is a fan art neon icon that he did of JpgPapii's 1/1 OG Snowboarder Quirkie! The Quirkie Holy Grail! 

Those that know @TrentPulsipher affectionately call him by his IRL name, Trent. Trent and I got to catch up and I asked him what inspired him to make his neon fan art. Trent told me " One night in late April at like 2 am, I remembered a YouTube video I had seen years ago. A guy did some neon effect graffiti on a wall and that was it, I hit the computer. I don't think I slept more than 2 hours and got up and kept rocking out my interpretation of others quirks". Trent has a long history with art. He is into graffiti style art and creates using many different mediums in his physical artworks. From spray paint, duct tape, epoxy, 3d printed objects and sculptures. The list goes on. This fellow Quirkie is very handy and loves to create!  Trent went on to tell me, "I don't really know why or how it came to me but that YouTube video hit me like a brick and I didn't go look for it, I just figured that I saw a video a couple years back and said to myself, 'I kinda remember his steps he explained, I am gonna try it'. I did it first using Bit Brits Flat Quirks as my template. I then did a regular Quirkie a couple weeks later and realized they looked even better". 

It is honestly really amazing that his work is all physically hand drawn and he just keeps getting better and refining his skills. If you have seen any of his recent pieces then you know exactly what I mean. Shortly after his work started getting some attention from other community members, Trent started minting them as NFTs under his Neon Icon collection and sending them to a few staples in the community and some even reached out for commission work. He has done Neon Icons for many well know quirks in Quirksville. JpgPapii, Bladeslap, 4961, Tony's Deli just to name a few. At some point he even did neon designs for Doom and Broken Jarhead's clothing collections. I for one am really excited to see what the fellas cook up with those designs! Trent was telling me  "Yeah, I did a quirk royalty design, a finch skull gang, and hockey mask mafia, and one for my favorite and most badass group, that GOO GANG". As Quirklings got ready for launch he consistently made Neon Icons for all of the sneak peeks the Quirkies team gave us as they dropped. Those pieces really are a sight to see. It seems Quirkies and FINCH O.N.E. really inspired Trent and he hasn't stopped creating neon fan art since! Trent pulled a Pink Goo Gang Quirk on reveal day and has been diamond handing it since like a true Quirkie Legend! 

His Neon Icon art work has been gaining traction in a few great communities and the future looks very bright for this Quirkie! Trent is dedicated to Web3 and is chomping at the bit to bring his ideas to life. He explained to me how excited he is to continue to keep pushing and learning new techniques to amplify his work while diving deeper down the Web3 rabbit hole. He really genuinely likes to create his neon art and loves meeting new people and making neon art for their favorite PFPs. 

Trent lives on a 27ft sailboat with his family and 2 cats, Steve & Bam, in Washington State, USA. He grinds out all this work in a small space with pretty spotty Wi-Fi and lots of loud seagulls in the background sound. All I can say is this dude is dedicated to Quirksville and this whole space in general. He seems determined to have a career in this Web3 digital art and from the sound of things, that may come to fruition very soon. Trent is inspired by his life experiences, street art, Web3 communities and digital design and seems very excited with the possibilities of helping people with his art in any way he can. I personally am excited to watch and see where he goes with the momentum he has building! All I know is it's going to be a amazing adventure! One of many that are happening everyday here in Quirksville!
