# Cocoa Magic Brownies

## I﻿ngredients:

1 1/4 C all-purpose flour (GF version I prefer Anson Mills GF Blend) 

2 C Cocoa 

1 1/2 teaspoons salt 

2 sticks room temperature unsalted butter, medium dice 

1 C Canola Oil 

4 large eggs 

1 1/2 C Sugar 

1 C Honey 

3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 

10 oz. Chocolate Chips

## D﻿irections:

Preheat Oven 325 degrees - spray a 9" x 13" baking tray and line with parchment paper. 

Step 1: Melt the butter and mix together with the oil. Set aside to cool.

Step 2: Sift together the flour, cocoa, cocoa magic, and salt. Set aside to mix in later.

Step 3: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the eggs, sugar and honey until the mixture is light and airy about 3-4 minutes. With the mixer running on lowest setting, slowly mix in the dry ingredients alternating with the oil and butter mix. Be careful not to over mix at this stage.

Step 4: Once everything is fully incorporated, remove bowl from mixer and fold in the chocolate chips.

S﻿tep 5: Pour brownie mixture into the pan and bake for 50 to 65 minutes. The edges should just start to pull away from the pan, and a tooth pick in the middle should come out clean. Make sure you don’t hit any chocolate chips when you test it.
