The piece I picked for the first fan art spotlight in the Quirkie Times is one that Kentasi did of Doom's incredible 1/1 Junk Bot Quirkie. This piece brought together two of the most legendary Quirksville members, Kentasi and Doom. I selected this piece because I wanted to showcase the amazing vibe in Quirksville and to give some love to a couple of OGs in our community while I did it. As many of us know, these fellas get on like a house fire and it's always a pleasure to watch it burn. Their bantering back and forth in spaces is hilarious to listen to and provides endless laughs at inside jokes that only OG quirks will remember. This is what it feels like to be in such a special & inclusive community like Quirksville and these fellas have been around for it all. 

There are many amazing artists in Quirksville but you will be hard pressed to find one more well known in this community than the legendary Kentasi. Kentasi has a background in creating logos and digital design. He has been a mentor and a teacher in his field and now leads a team of designers with his launch of Kentasi Studio. Kentasi realized at some point that he wanted to go beyond logos, marketing and brand work and move into a field that really captured emotion and also evoked emotion in people that viewed his work. Kentasi has a strong sense of feeling and is very passionate about how his art makes people feel when they see it. The feeling and the emotion seem to be what is most important to him and it was really incredible to chat with him and learn about his inspiration for his digital art.

I was grateful to be able to catch up on a call with Kentasi and get a little insight as to what drives his inspiration for his fan art and love for our great community. Kentasi and I talked about what first got him interested in Quirksville. He told me that he had seen a friend of his change his PFP to a Skeleton 1/1 Quirkie NFT and Kentasi decided to make his own derivative of it and give to his friend as a gift. That first piece of Quirkie fan art was posted and received a massive out pouring of love from the community and got over 200 likes on that post in a short amount of time! He was blown away. Kentasi explained to me how he was inspired by the Quirkies artist Finch One and his use of the emotional expressions that the Quirkies display in the collection. Kentasi wants to create and capture emotions with his art and this seems to be something he is very focused on when he creates and is also truly inspired by. Kentasi loves the people he has met and adores the relationships he has built within the Quirkies ecosystem and uses those relationships as inspiration for his art. He told me that sometimes his inspiration for the fan art is the emotion that the Quirkie evokes within himself. Then other times, the inspiration and the art has a special meaning because of his relationship with the person he creates it for. I know that is the case with this piece he did for Doom of his 1/1 Quirkie Junk Bot.  

Kentasi and Doom are well know for their hilarious attitudes in spaces and the way they banter back and forth. In the early Quirkie spaces, Kentasi was joking with Doom about how Doom's wife was always in the background. Kentasi is learning to speak English and he is getting really good. At the time, his joke came out in a way that was hilarious and basically said that Doom's wife was controlling him and was the one who wore the pants in the relationship. After speaking with Kentasi, I realized this joke is forever memorialized in the piece he did for Doom. Kentasi said he really wanted to highlight the Junk Bot's robotic qualities and as we can see he did that so well with his incredible 3D artwork. This piece is sharply defined and super crispy, I love it. I am also a fan of the pink backgrounds. I don't know what it is, but it seems to be a theme in my personal collection of quirks. Kentasi also wanted to incorporate the joke that he had made in spaces with Doom into the piece. The way he achieved that was by including Doom's Finch Skull Quirk flying around in the airplane. Kentasi explained to me that the idea behind that is the Quirkie in the plane represents Doom's wife and she is, from afar, controlling the Junk Bot who represents Doom. This was a perfect example of Kentasi using his art to evoke emotions and capture the feeling of a new friendship being made in this community. The hilarious misspoken joke and beginning of their friendship was now memorialized in a digital art piece for Doom to have.

After talking with Kentasi I realized how truly awesome he really is and I thought to myself, this dude has got to be really handsome. He has so much love for the Quirkie community and all of the people in it. He rattled off many Quirk's names, attributes, skills and personality traits he loved about them and he talked about how the people he has met and relationships he has built are the reason he will never leave Quirksville . Kentasi said that " holding a Quirkie is like having a membership pass to the coolest group of people". We both agreed that anyone can jump in and vibe with the quirks of course and we treat everyone with love and respect but holding a Quirkie elevates that feeling and makes it even more fun.  He talked about how many communities focus on the floor price, the dev team, or utility. And with Quirkies none of that matters because of the amazing vibes and the insanely diverse Quirkie community that builds out Quirksville and makes everyone feel welcome like family.

I decided to wrap up our conversation with a Quirkie question. I asked Kentasi if he had to choose one trait to come to life and be a part of him in real life what would it be? Kentasi was very quick to explain that his number one most desired trait to be in the collection would be a beer. This came as no surprise to me, of course. We all know how much Kentasi loves his beers. We laughed about when he started dropping the beer head quirks. If you remember that, you have been riding with us for a good while! He went on to explain that his favorite trait is the Finch Skull because of how easy it is to love at first sight. It evokes emotion, its simple, yet clean and very universal. He told me how this trait has great usability and having the IP rights to a finch skull could be used in so many different creative applications. 

All in all, the conversation was incredible and I could tell how much love Kentasi has for his friends and fam in Quirksville. It made me feel so good to really understand how much of a positive impact this space can have on everyone that participates in it. Simple things like joking around in spaces can lead to amazing digital creations and new friendships like Kentasi and Doom now have. The Quirkies are all about bringing people together and making everyone feel welcome while we build this empire brick by brick, and I know Kentasi is a big part of creating the feeling that we get when we vibe with our fam in Quirksville.
