Q﻿uirkie of the Week #10 - @Princessashleiv

Hey y’all! First off, although Syntribos forced me to take this win – I just want to express my gratitude for the Citizens of Quirksville. There is literally no other community like ours. By day I am a HR Analyst and by night I am the Donut Queen. I have three amazing kids and two of them are OBSESSED with Quirkies. I wonder where they might have picked that up from? I originally got into NFTs to flip but when I met the Quirkies, I understood that this was something special and I couldn’t leave. It has been an absolute pleasure to serve this community and I can’t wait to see where this goes.

You know me as air-in or [@juicemanzadeh](https://twitter.com/juicemanzadeh), but IRL, I’m just Aron. Not A-aron, don’t need that extra A. I joined Quirksville back in March and have loved this project and community ever since. A lot of you now know me as Co-host of Sniper Sunday w/ CoJo, Dabs & Jim & Artist Monday w/ CoJo, but I wasn’t always this visible. The coolest thing about this project is that it’s easy to find your voice, develop your leadership skills and more plainly, just be yourself. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting and hanging with some incredible Quirks IRL and that won’t stop — Quirksville has turned into my tinder to meet some of my best friends. I live in LA with my dog Jax and we head to the beach pretty frequently. I’ve worked in Marketing and Advertising for more than a decade, most recently at Red Bull and now Rockstar Energy — which is why Quirks spoke to me. An action sports brand leaning into kid-friendly art? Sign me TF up. I’ve been working for the last 3 months on a Quirks IP project, which will be released this year … but that’s all I’ll say for now. Can’t wait to share it with all of you and see more of you IRL!
