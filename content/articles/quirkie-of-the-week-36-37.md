It will always be Quirkies for the win. It’s SWOO here aka SquidSwoO. We are in it to win it. Love our community. I love our great community leaders as well as the artist and of course, the founder. "A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way." I love how strong we all are and literally building our foundation brick by brick. It’s been a honor to be accepted by you all, without you there is no me so Thank you for the nomination, very appreciated. Always remember “it’s in US - not ON US” leadership starts within so always believe in yourself xoxo - SwoO

Hey Quirksville, my name is Jason or JClutch on Twitter and Discord. I’m currently a software engineer living in New York City and I was able to purchase my first Quirkie on February 15th, not too long after reveal. The community is what really sold me as I was creeping on spaces and enjoying those conversations around the space and entrepreneurship. Since then, I’ve worked to organize and host meetups for the NYC quirks, launch [http://quirkexplorer.com](https://t.co/P1zlaYlUWh) , and still have a couple more things in the pipeline. I have traded a few sets during our cross community events but I’m still at 9 sets and plan to pick up a few more once Coinbase stops flagging my account. If you’re ever in the city I’m always down to find time to grab coffee or a drink with a fellow Quirk. And if you live in NYC / Tri-state area and have a Quirk/Quirkling, hit me up and let’s add you to the group!
