Finch O.N.E. grew up in the 90’s and watched “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” & “Biker Mice from Mars”, which is where most of his inspiration is sparked from. Bright colors and crazy art styles were prominent, and he doesn’t fall short on them. Do you remember plastering posters all over your bedroom wall as a teenager? What were your favorite posters? A young Finch had influences from bands such as Green Day and Blink-182 along with Tony Hawk’s pro skater artwork and surfer posters. Graffiti influences play heavily in Finch’s artwork but while he was spray painting skulls all over the place, everyone else was graffiti writing. I don’t know how much I believe this, but he claims he doesn’t have great handwriting. Finch describes himself as elusive back then, he never wanted to be infamous and didn’t want a “name” for himself. If you attended NFT NYC, you know that Finch’s arms are filled with tattoos! It became a burning question for everyone what the inspiration behind his tattoos was. He explained that there wasn’t any real direction or inspiration to his permanent artwork other than he knew he wanted a heap of color, and he went with a very classic Japanese style for them with the hopes that the style will never go out of fashion. He fancies walking into the tattoo parlors and allowing someone artistic freedom to do whatever they are inspired to do in that moment. A Finch Skull tattoo is on the list to happen, but as of now Finch doesn’t have any Quirkies tattoos. We all know that the skulls are his favorite trait in the OG collection, but I am happy to report that his favorite Quirkling traits are the space cow hat, the platypus and the frog! Since the Quirklings are the protectors and “muscle”, a lot of the traits are based on superheroes.

The story behind how Finch and Syntribos met is a simple but funny one since Finch is extremely shy. Finch is a huge fan of the *Bored Ape Yacht Club* art because it highlights monkeys and apes but more importantly, it was the creation of 10,000 unique digital pieces of art generated by an “X” number of layers that sparked his curiosity. It even reminded him of the artwork from “South Park” and that is what really caused interest in trying it out for himself to see how it worked. About a month or so before the Quirkies twitter was made, Finch began spamming anyone with a Bored Ape who mentioned they were building in Web3 with “I’m an artist, I’m an artist” to put himself out there. When they finally connected, Syn already had his idea of Quirksville and what he wanted a Quirkie to look like. It was almost a “love at first sight” connection between the two of them. Syn sent Finch an example and told him what he wanted the eyes to look like, and Finch provided four images after half an hour later – the rest is history! Finch took note that other projects he was speaking to at that time wanted artwork that mimicked other projects that launched but Syn had an original idea with original artwork and a vision at hand. Finch didn’t have any history or knowledge in Web3 prior to this, except he was a fan of the *Adam Bomb Squad* NFT and even bigger fan of “genius” Bobby Hundreds. He remembers wanting it and when he went to buy it, it was the equivalent of 250 pounds and in his mind – that was an outrageous price for a JPEG! He scrolled on by the project, but emphasized that in Web3, you need educators. You can’t expect to just buy something like a NFT and not understand how it works, what it does, utility, etc. To this day, Finch is looking forward to the metaverse and the gaming and 3D aspect of it, but he still doesn’t dive into cryptocurrency or anything else Web3 – it is simply about the art for him. Speaking of Web3 art, Finch is a fan of Polly Kole (@polly_kole) who is known for her legendary NFT sculptures. Check her out!

So what has Finch excited these days? Watching the Quirkies community build their own empires with the IP rights that they have acquired is something that Finch is looking forward to. He is astonished at the idea of this community getting excited over his artwork and fighting over traits to be able to build. The future of Finch O.N.E. is very clear in his eyes: he does aspire to eventually branch off and own an art studio and merchandise line for himself. He has a long-term plan in mind that he is chipping away at in his mind every day. However, his heart belongs to Quirkies and will continue to give his all for the collection as he shows his gratitude towards Syntribos for being the “genius he is and knowing exactly what he’s doing in this space”. Their tag-team mentality works best: Finch handles the artwork and Syn manages the business while neither one of them worries about the other. He and Syn are currently working tirelessly on the next steps of the collection, which accounts for Finch’s absence on Twitter. Syn has him locked away but at least feeds him throughout the day! In his spare time when he isn’t locked away doing his art, you can find Finch touching grass and ocean! He isn’t one to lay around the house; he was brought up on skateboarding, but he spends a lot of time surfing even though he thinks he isn’t good at it. Maybe Syn can teach him a thing or two about riding a wave? I can assure you that Quirkies won’t be the end of Finch O.N.E. – he will be around for a VERY long time and can’t wait to show the rest of Web3 what his beautiful mind has cooking.
