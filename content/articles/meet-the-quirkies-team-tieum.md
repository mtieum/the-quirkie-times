Tieum (pronounced ti: ɛm) is currently a lead engineer at a web agency in the UK while juggling the newly acquired position as developer with Quirkies. He’s been with the agency for five years but prior to that, he was with another agency totalling 10 years in the UK industry and many more years overall. His education includes the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree with a specialty in IT infrastructure and security.

When Tieum was 11 years old he received his first computer, but he really wanted to understand how they work; he took the computer apart himself and began building it back together piece by piece. After he put it back together, Tieum then installed his own Linux Distro on the computer. In 1999-2000, Tieum and his friend built the first ecommerce website for Singer, a popular sewing machine brand (that my grandmother probably had back in the day) that wasn’t quite easy to do back then. Around 18 years old, Tieum began gaining momentum with some jobs and by the age of 21, he owned and operated his own IT specialist company – which focused on the infrastructure and backups of the business systems. The company also sold a product that was like PABX.

2015 was the year that Tieum invested in cryptocurrency but missed the train on Bitcoin. He also mined his share of doge coin and Ethereum as well. In addition to that, Tieum has also setup several blockchain nodes for staking proof mechanism. In 2019, he began studying smart contracts in his downtime, but it didn’t really register for him. It wasn’t until 2020 that he dove deep into the world of smart contracts. Towards the end of 2021, he met Signline in another project which led to Tieum jumping into the voice chat every day with Signline, Jack and Sleapy. The rest is history!

If there was something that Tieum could change in the space, he hopes that one day a decentralized social platform will be built by and for web3 but adopted by the masses .
