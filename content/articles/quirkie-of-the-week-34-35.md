**Q﻿uirkie of the Week #4** - Coj04

Hello Quirksville! Thank you for choosing me as Quirkie of the Week, I am honored. I love this project and community. You all know me as CoJo but Corey works too! Some of you might know me as one of the spaces hosts - I have been hosting Sniper Sunday from the very beginning. It started with Mac and I and now it is Air-in, Dabs, & myself. I am very thankful to host with them - we have a blast every week. Air-in and I also host Artist Monday, we are very excited for the cross community spaces we have coming up. I strongly believe that we need to work together in this space to succeed. That idea is what framed the future of Artist Monday. I joined Quirksville the day it revealed. The art is what grabbed my attention at first, I fell in love with it the second I saw it. I grew up snowboarding, skateboarding and riding motocross so the skate and surf brand really spoke to me. But, what has kept me here is all of you. I am very thankful for the friends I have made this past year. If you are reading this and are not very active in the community, or any community for that matter. I urge you to reach out to us. There are some amazing people in this community and I promise you doing that will change the way you look at web3. I am very excited to ride this road-map out with you all!

**Q﻿uirkie of the Week #5** - JpegsAreCool

Quirksville! My home… my family. Hey, I’m Austin, better known to you all as Jpegsarecool, and thank you so much for voting for me this week. I reside in a suburb of Los Angeles, CA with my wife Emma (just married!), our 2 kids and our 2 cats. I’m a TV + film editor and on the board of directors of the editor’s guild. I also recently trained to referee for our son’s soccer team! However my biggest, craziest desire is to leave the film world to do something completely different. Beyond my obsession with jpegs, I love talking with people and creating communities, and you can’t do much of that behind a computer monitor by yourself in a dark room all day… which is why I started Quirk Brothers! For months I had been thinking about ways to use my NFT IPs to start a project, whether it was NFT related like Jenkins the Valet or an IRL product like Fren Blen. I played with lots of ideas, none really feeling right or authentic to the space. That changed a few weeks ago when I was invited to the “Beard Bros” Quirkie beard trait chat. They asked me if I had any ideas to set the beard bros apart, and it hit me: my wife is amazing with aromatherapy and had been making me homemade beard oils... what if we made Quirkies beard oil? That idea has now snowballed into something potentially much bigger: beard oil for the entire web3 space. Think about how many collections have beard traits: Alien Frens, RTFKT CloneX, CryptoPunks, the list goes on. What if we could feature IP from as many collections as possible, and in the process acquire and license IP from holders to create IRL royalty streams? Whoa 

But no matter how many different collections get involved, Quirk Bros. is Quirkies-inspired and community-led. Our first product based on Quirkling 8451, Obi Qan, will be available for online purchase on September 17 for .025ETH including free shipping, ordering details to come. Please consider supporting my wife and I in our new venture, and getting me out from an edit bay into the real world. And if you’re going to Frens Fest LA - see you there! Love you fam, and thank you again!!
