Q: Have you always created art or was this something that you developed a passion/interest for at a certain point in life?

B: I always enjoyed drawing and video games growing up as a kid. I think the combination of the two really developed my passion and love for digital art. Throughout my career, I’ve done it all - freelanced, worked for a corporation and designed for fun. I really prefer designing for fun! Lately, I find the most enjoyment collaborating, creating, and designing with my Quirkie family! 

Q: What is your ideal setting for feeling creative, productive, able to reach that flow state? 

B: For me personally, I enjoy high collaboration when it comes to creating. I love brainstorming with other people that don’t see things the way I normally see them. It’s important to get outside of my own head when getting into a design flow. I believe the best creative idea is built from a hybrid of ideas from multiple people. 

Q: Do you have a preferred medium? 

B: I really enjoy working with all types! Lately I have been working on my Digital Animation skills. I’m not very good at it, but it’s definitely the most fun for me to be creating with! 

Q: What sparked the idea for Flat Quirkies? 

B: What really sparked the idea was how easy it was to fall in love with FinchOne’s Quirkie collection. I had been doing some fanart before I found Quirkies, but this collection just felt so different from the others in how welcoming, accepting and supportive everyone was. So I really wanted to find a way to contribute directly to the community and help make people feel special and welcomed to the family like I was. Flat Quirkies just originated out of that love for Finch’s work and the desire to help create a fun, loving community for others. Thank you to Syn and Finch for allowing Flat Quirkies to happen!

Q: How was the process of taking your art from digital to physical? Anything that was easier or more difficult than expected? 

B: I worked as a Graphic Designer for a corporation for 7 years. Throughout those 7 years, I created a lot of digital and print assets for the company. So I was familiar with the digital to print side of things, but the addition of IP rights and personally shipping packages was a whole new arena for me. Luckily I had a large family of Quirkies who were more knowledgeable than I was to lend their thoughts and wisdom. Having them support and advise me made the process extremely fun and seamless! Shoutout to all of you - you know who you are! :)

Q: Flat Quirkies are now printed as a deck of playing cards that are currently making it into the hands of Web3 community members. What an accomplishment! What is next for art by Bit Brit? 

B: Oh wow, what a loaded question! There are a few things in the works right now - I’m collaborating with a handful of other community members on some Community Lore projects which I’m REALLY excited about and I’m sure we will be seeing a Volume 2 Flat Quirkies Playing Cards deck release soon as well! 

Q: Thank you for sharing more about yourself. Is there anything else you’d like to leave us with? (No pressure. This is completely optional in case you felt like anything wasn’t covered that you’d like to share.) 

B: You guys are amazing. Thank you so much for thinking of me! I’m truly honored! <3 <3 <3
