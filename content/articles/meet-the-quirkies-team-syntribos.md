The Quirkies Originals is taking the Web3 world by storm with amazing & unique artwork and a team that never stops delivering. We may know the team on Twitter but we wanted to take an intimate dive into who the magic makers are behind the Quirkies. This issue, we focus on Syntribos, an icon coming from Sydney, Australia. He’s widely known for his stellar performances during last year’s “ZedRun” phenomenon. Syntribos aka “Syn” quickly rose to web3 fame during his days of streaming live on Twitch, demonstrating to the world how great he was at racing virtual horses. You’ll be surprised to know that Syn’s background is quite different from his web3 life.

Syn has over 10 years of experience in the financial markets, ranging from risk management to corporate finance. His strengths include understanding how the operations of a business function, raising funds and increasing the value of those businesses. Figuring out which companies would benefit most from cash injections is no easy task, as well as allocating resources to where they are needed most. However, Syn has taken these tedious tasks and demonstrated time and time again that he knows what he is doing. He takes pride in building businesses in multiple facets, both personal & professional, and continues to study the markets to learn where the next drive is going to be.

The most successful venture that Syn has accomplished would have to be a fintech business that had a valuation of approximately $20M and over the course of a 2-year period, had taken it to market with a valuation of over $1B at its peak. A lot of research was done to figure out where the next push was going to come from in terms of market sentiment and industry shifts. But it was the idea of building the infrastructure & foundation of the business first, followed by pushing the marketing of the business in a mature market that allowed for it to take off, ensuring that funds were allocated in a meaningful way when the time was right. The competitors had been focused on marketing before building the foundation in a time where they needed to do the opposite. Syn seems to have a niche for patience and smart navigation within markets!

Success isn’t obtained overnight; it is built over a period of time. Syn mentioned that he has been speaking to major corporations regarding the project but most of the meetings have turned into a learning opportunity as web2 brands have a few misconceptions of how the web3 space works. However, investing the time into that relationship with the corporations displays dedication and could very well be the deciding factor to a game-changing deal for the Quirkies. His 5-year plan for the Quirkies includes a complete build out of the web2 brand while creating the bridge between web2 and web3, which translates into multiple streams of revenue funneling to and from each component with utility to the holders. A strong, significant global web2 brand enhances the idea of the sports and streetwear culture which could potentially lead to some major partnerships and opens the opportunity for IRL events/representation. Web3 tends to move quickly but one thing is for sure: Syntribos is a calculated mastermind who wants to make sure the Quirkies become a household name around the world.
