**Fan Art spotlight** - one piece of art (quirkies or non-quirkies related) with a shout out to the artist 

Quirkie Community Member Interview - after the team introductions have concluded, we can move on to having community spotlights (video interviews would be AMAZING) 

Matt’s Security Quiz - I’ll let him touch more on that 

Classifieds - a place where people are looking for talent/skills for projects and can advertise! 

Quirkie of the Week - Spotlight on a member who made a crazy purchase, raided extra hard or did something unexpected for another member. 

Something fun - a crossword puzzle or a little comic strip or a coloring scene. 

Finally, an Easter egg - this will come from the team. Some sort of teaser for the community to get hype and talk about.
