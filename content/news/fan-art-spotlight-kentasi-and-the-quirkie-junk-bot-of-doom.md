description: "A spotlight on a amazing piece of Quirkie fan art by the legendary
  digital artist Kentasi "

The piece i picked  for the first fan art spotlight in the Quirkie Times is one that Kentasi did of Doom's incredible 1/1 Junk Bot Quirkie. This piece brought together 2 of the most legendary Quirksville members, Kentasi and Doom. I selected this piece becuse I wanted to showcase the amazing vibe in quirksville and to show some love to a couple OGs in our community. As many of us know these fellas get on like a dumpster fire and it's always a pleasure to watch it burn. The bantering back and forth in spaces. The endless laughs and plenty beers. Inside jokes that only OG quirks remember. This is what it feels like to be in such a special inclusive community like Quirksville and these fellas have been around for it all. 

There are many amazing artists in quirksville but you will be hard pressed to find one more well know in this community than the legendary Kentasi. I was greatful to be able to catch up on a call with kentasi and get a little insight as to what drives his inspiration and love for our great community. Kentasi and I talked about what first got him interested in quirksville. He explained to me that he had seen a friend of his change his PFP to a quirkie and kentasi decided to make his own derivative of it and give to his friend as a gift. That first piece of quirkie fan art was what sent him down the quirkie rabbit hole.
