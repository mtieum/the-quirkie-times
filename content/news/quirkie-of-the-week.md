Hi Quirkie Family, my name is Damien (BlackSeries). I live in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago with my wife Lisa of 20 years and 2 wonderful children, Braden and Brooklyn. I am currently a Finance Director for Mercedes-Benz. I have 21 quirkie alpha sets plus a bunch of miscellaneous quirkies. I truly appreciate this entire community and everything it stands for. The future for the Quirkie Family looks so bright - brick by brick.
